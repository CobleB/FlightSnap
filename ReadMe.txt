Summary:
This code was developed by Ben Coble and Sara Remsen as a final project for 1.001. Our d3 code was derived from sample code from Mike Bostock's hierarchical edge bundling D3 example (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999) after completing several d3 tutorials to understand the capabilities and frameworks for the language and given the specific requirements of our bird data set from ebird. We experimented with several d3 visualizations to find the best match for our use case. This code uses one of dataset at a time (split by month) to draw individual visualizations. Index.html displays the visualization directly in a browser using a local web server.Files included:
* Raw eBird Data.xlsx – the raw dataset that was provided from eBird* eBirdSightings.js – contains an array of 42,000 objects. Each object represents one bird sighting, and has the following properties: (Note – these objects were initially created to have these properties to give us the flexibility to use the data in different ways, although our final code doesn’t need every property)o OutingID (a unique ID number assigned by eBird)o Montho Yearo Countyo Common (common name of the bird sighted)o Scientific (scientific name of the bird sighted)The code at the bottom of this file consolidates these individual sightings into Outings, and exports them to the javascript file eBirdOutings.js* eBirdOutings.js – contains an array of approximately 2,000 objects, one for every outing in Massachusetts during 1904-2004. The Common and Scientific object properties contain arrays that list all birds sighted on the outing in question.* BirdNames.js – contains an array of the 333 unique bird species sighted in Massachusetts from 1904-2004. This file is referenced by the BirdFiltering file described below:* BirdFiltering.js – file that filters through the outings and creates a new array of objects, containing mainbird and cobirds properties. The mainbird is one species, and the cobirds are an array of all birds sighted with the mainbird. This file was used to export the final json files which were used with D3. These 12 files are named by month (“all_Jan04Data.json” for January, etc)* Index.hmtl — file that contains the web HTML as well as the D3 code to create the visualization. D3 is automatically loaded into the file, so no need to download additional files. To run the visualization, you need to run a local web server to load the external dataset. The file for the dataset can be updated within the code itself.
